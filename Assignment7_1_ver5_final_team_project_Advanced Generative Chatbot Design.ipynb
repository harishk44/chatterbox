    "The F1 score measures the balance between precision and recall, with a score of 87.5% indicating that most of the model’s generated tokens overlap with the ground truth. <br>\n",
    "What This Implies:<br>\n",

    "Processing 10 inputs in 10 seconds indicates the model is performing efficiently, especially if running on GPU with batch processing.<br>\n",
    "Takeaway:<br>\n",

    "Achieving 100% EM and F1 Score may not always be realistic, but some strategies to further enhance performance:<br>\n",
    "Fine-tune the model further on domain-specific data.<br>\n",
    "Post-process the model output to match the expected format (e.g., handling synonyms).<br>\n",
    "Refine your dataset to ensure ground truth answers are aligned in format and phrasing with expected responses.<br><br>\n",
    "**6. Real-World Applications**<br>\n",
    "With these scores, your model is well-suited for:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer support chatbots: It generates accurate and relevant answers with little deviation.<br>\n",
    "Educational tools: The high F1 score ensures the model provides meaningful responses even if not phrased exactly.<br>\n",
